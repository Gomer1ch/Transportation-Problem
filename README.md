## Key Features

- **Intuitive User Interface**  
  A graphical interface built with **Tkinter** allows easy input of costs, constraints (supply), and fuzzy consumer demands.

- **Fuzzy Logic Integration**  
  Accounts for uncertainty by modeling customer demands using **fuzzy logic**, offering solutions adaptable to real-world variability.

- **Optimization using Simplex Method**  
  Employs **linear programming techniques** (`scipy.optimize.linprog`) to find cost-efficient transportation plans.

- **Detailed Results**  
  Provides step-by-step insights, including:
  
  - Reliability of cost efficiency  
  - Consumer satisfaction levels  
  - Optimal transportation strategies

- **Interactive Data Visualization**  
  Generates clear, interactive graphs to analyze and illustrate **reliability and optimization trade-offs**.
